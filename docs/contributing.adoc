=== How to Contribute

The Last.Backend project is Apache 2.0 licensed and accepts contributions via GitHub pull requests.
This document outlines some of the conventions on commit message formatting, contact points for developers and other resources to make getting your contribution accepted.

==== How to contribute to open source on GitHub

Please, read the https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/[contributing to open source], before contributing.

==== Benefits for active contributors

**Limited free Last.Backend cloud resources**

==== Coding Style

1. All code should be formatted with `gofmt`
2. All code should follow the guidelines covered in Effective Go and Go Code Review Comments.
3. Comment the code. Tell us the why, the history and the context.
4. Variable name length should not be too long.

Great materials to read:

* https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html[Effective Go]
* https://blog.golang.org[The Go Blog]
* https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments[Code Review Comments]

Great tools to use:

- https://github.com/kisielk/errcheck[ErrCheck] - a program for checking for unchecked errors in Go programs.
- https://github.com/golang/lint[GoLint] - a linter for Go source code.

==== Reporting issues

1. Tell us version of Last.Backend you use
2. Include the steps required to reproduce the problem, if possible

=== Support

While there are many different channels that you can use to get hold of us (Issues, Forums/Mailing lists),
you can help to make sure that we are efficient in getting you the help that you need.

Before opening a new issue, it's helpful to search the project - it's likely that another user has already reported the issue you're facing,
or it's a known issue that we're already aware of.

If you need support, start with the troubleshooting guide and work your way through the process that we've outlined.

That said, if you have questions, reach out to us one way or another. We don't bite!
