== Overview

Last.Backend is an open source platform for containerized application management on all stages: from deploy to scale.
This solution is based on container technology and fully support docker containers type.

Note that project is under active development and our team is working day and night to make it better.
Your suggestions, comments and contributions is very helpful. Big thanks for that!

=== About Container platform

Container platform is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
It contains a set of technologies like: container scheduling, service discovery, overlay network, container runtime, container images runtime, load-balancing and more.
All these technologies are provided out of the box and don't requiring additional research and setup.

=== Platform structure:

- REST API server.
  Entrypoint for cluster management.

- State controller.
  Cluster state watcher. Performs all operation for pod creating and manage entities lifecycle.

- Resources Scheduler.
  Resources scheduler operates with cluster resources. It handles all resources utilization requests and manages entities spreading across cluster.

- Node agent.
  Node agent is process that operates with host. It creates pods, endpoint, networks, load-balancers and other entities.

- Service discovery.
  Service discovery is internal DNS server. It manages services IPs with internal domain names.

- Ingress proxy.
  Proxy server, based on self-configurable HAproxy. Manages External traffic from WEB to internal overlay network.

- Log collector.
  Log collector stores and aggregates logs from whole cluster. It can export logs to external database for additional analytic and search.

- IPVS-based load-balancer.
  Load-Balancer that provides traffic management across pods in cluster.

- VxLAN-based overlay network
  Overlay network connects all docker hosts into one big overlay network, where pods from different nodes can access each other.

- Storage runtime driver
  Driver implements persistent storage for pods. It adds ability to deploy stateful services.

- Container runtime
  Container runtime is responsible to manage containers in host. Docker runtime driver is used by default.

- Container images runtime
  Container runtime is responsible to manage container images in host. Docker container images driver is used by default.


=== Runtimes overview

Last.Backend runtime design allows us to create extendable system. We separated runtime into particular packages.

By default Last.Backend is provided with these runtimes:

- CRI - container runtime interface: docker by default
- CII - container image interface: docker by default
- CSI - container storage interface: host directory by default
- CNI - container network interface: vxlan by default
- CPI - container proxy interface: IPVS by default

All these runtimes are documented in runtime section. where all methods, types and algorithms are described.


=== Endpoint interface
The main endpoint to manage cluster is REST API interface.
Our team uses swagger as API documentation generator. To create swagger spec, just execute ``` make swagger-spec``` command in root of repository.


You can use REST API in these options:

- Directly with CURL or another apps
- Using Last.Backend CLI located in separate repo lastbackend/cli[https://github.com/onedomain/cli]
- Using golang package, located in `pgk/api/client`. For building custom go apps as example.

=== Current state

Current version is in public beta stage and includes:

- cluster management
- node management
- overlay network based on vxlan
- internal endpoints for pods balancing based on IPVS
- ingress server based on haproxy
- internal discovery server
- services management with basic blue/green deployments
- volumes management
